And I really tried...a few days with different techniques...was sheer and patchy.  No matter what I did, I just couldn't get it to blend well without just coming off.  And no matter how short or long I waited after applying - the setting powder just made it patchier.   If Lancome doesn't restock their full coverage concealer, I'll be at a loss."

It provides a perfect blend of coverage and a natural, radiant finish that doesn’t look cakey or heavy. The added hyaluronic acid feels amazing on my skin, keeping it hydrated throughout the day, which is a huge plus for my under-eye area. I used it every day until I finished it and am already planning to repurchase! I loved it so much that I even bought the matching foundation to complete my look. Highly recommend this concealer for anyone looking for a blend of skincare and flawless makeup!"

It’s lightweight, which feels comfortable for all-day wear, and the added hyaluronic acid provides a boost of hydration, helping the product feel more like skincare than makeup. However, I noticed that it doesn’t hold up as well in high-humidity environments or on oily skin without setting powder. It works best on drier areas, brightening them without settling into fine lines too much. Overall, this is a nice option for those who want a more luminous, skin-like finish. I’d say it’s best suited for normal to dry skin types who prefer a natural look."

This is a beautiful, lightweight, water-based concealer with medium buildable coverage. The best part? NO SILICONES!! I have very sensitive skin that is extremely reactive to silicones in products, causing cystic and closed comedones when used. I almost gave up ever being able to find makeup I could wear because they all contained silicones or were extremely drying and flaky on my face. Not this one! It is so beautiful and leaves a dewy glow on my skin, I use this as a lightweight foundation that's how much I love it! It stays on all day and doesn't separate from my skin or flake (another major problem I faced with base makeup). It's affordable and lasts a long time (even when used daily). Seriously, if you have sensitive skin like me that is prone to pore-clogging and is on the dryer/combo side, this allowed me to wear base makeup again. I love it! Thank you, Lancome!"

			"review_text": "I've been using this concealer practically every day for a few months. In general, it's definitely worth every cent. It's very hydrating and dewy! It's sheer coverage but i personally don't see this as being very buildable. It's great for a lightweight, natural look. It blends so well (i blend with my fingertips or a slightly damp beauty blender).     I'm pale (think like, 'timothee chalamet' pale) and the 120N was the closest shade match I could find. I also haven't noticed any irritation. I have textured, oily-combo skin with large subcutaneous glands. This concealer wears off fairly quick, maybe four hours after application? I don't recommend if you sweat a bunch or live in a humid climate.  I use this underneath foundation and it gives me a near-perfect base! It performs so well underneath the other layers of makeup. I layer Fit Me! Matte Foundation in 112N over it.   I used Burt's Bee's Cheek Tint as a blush along with Iconic London's Liquid Illuminator Highlight (in the reddish blush shade). It doesn't pill or soak away the pigment like other serum-based makeup.   It hides my redness perfectly, and evens out my skin tone without looking overdone. I use this concealer by itself on days I stay in, or generally speaking, whenever I don't feel like doing a full face lol.   It's the best concealer on the market imo & the best choice for textured / rough skin."

Let me tell you, it’s that good. Seriously the perfect everyday concealer. I’ve never had a better shade for me in a concealer. I had dry skin but I love lightweight concealers. I can never find one that is light and hydrating, until the Lancôme Care and Glow. This stuff was seriously life changing for me! The coverage is medium but buildable.

When I used this product it left my skin with a dewy glow but definitely not “over done,” and one layer lasted most of the day for me.  Since the base of this product is serum it melts right into my skin instead of just sitting on top of my skin, and it surprisingly matched my skin tone to a T!

My favorite thing about this concealer is how it feels on my skin. It feels like I'm not wearing makeup, and it has a really natural satin finish - which I prefer. It also felt really hydrating on my undereye area. If you haven't had the chance to try it yet, you should. I really like it for the no makeup makeup look."

I tested the shade 120N; which is quite light of course, and a decent color for areas where I needed some brightening and concealer work. Lancome is a tried and trusted brand, and I am a fan of their complexion products in general. I think to use this product regularly moving forward, I would potentially need a different shade to get a true concealing effect for blemishes.  I did notice that the concealer would cling a bit to areas that had dry skin, like healing blemishes, or face fuzz. It took on a bit of a patchy appearance then. Otherwise, it concealed well with build-up, and didn’t cause any additional drying out of the skin.   The applicator is comfortable with curved and flat areas to allow use anywhere on the face, with medium buildable coverage. I personally had more success blending this in with a tapping motions or a sponge rather than blending in with a rubbing or brushing motion as the product tended to move around just a bit on application. This gets better when applied over a base vs bare skin.  I appreciate the concealer’s added skin benefits, particularly as my skin matures (and the rest of my body honestly, haha). This product contains 71% serum base with hyaluronic acid and ceramides. I am curious if all of the added benefits would properly penetrate your skin when using this on top of primer and foundation.  Based on my personal skin and experience, I rate this product a 7 to 7.5 out of 10!"

I love that it glides on the delicate under eye skin, super smooth without tugging. The coverage is buildable which is great for days you need a little more! The serum makes me feel better about what I’m putting on my skin. I can’t wait to incorporate it more fully into my makeup routine!"

The cons of this product to me is the size of the concealer application brush. It was extra large. Also, the shade matching was not spot on. It was a little brighter than I Normally use, so I definitely needed a darker shade.  I’m a huge fan of the Lancôme brand and I look forward to using more of their products.  I have a combination skin type, but I’m closer to the dry side . The coverage of this concealer wasn’t buildable to me. It did brighten my skin, but the shade was a little lighter than my normal tone, so that was a negative aspect for me.  I did notice that the product had a thicker consistency than usual, but I didn’t notice any nourishment."

I got the pleasure of trying this time Lancôme Teint Idole Ultra Wear Care & Glow  Concealer. This is my first time I get to use a Lancôme concealer and first time I use a concealer that contains serum.  I really like this product because as I mentioned before it contains serum that actually brightens and has other ingredients such as hyaluronic acid, ceramides and peptides that will hydrate your skin.  Also, this is such an amazing product because comparing with other concealers that I’ve used before, this one is super  lightweight that, you can’t even noticed you use one.  In my case I tried this product on my dark circles under my eyes. It actually blended well and the color  310N worked out perfectly with my skin color.  I highly recommend this product because is not only a regular makeup but also is a skincare product!"

I wouldn't add close to eyebrows as it didn't work seamlessly for me but under foundation for touchups I like it. The brush wasn't my fav as I prefer a smaller dot brush but it is angled which helps for larger areas. Overall great for many needs but as someone who doesn't wear a lot of makeup daily I couldn't use this much without foundation over it and that isn't really my usual routine."

Received 305N color and Retails for $29.00 for 13 ML /0.43 FL Oz Size.   What It Is: A multi-use, medium coverage serum concealer with up to 24hr hydration and a natural, soft glow finish. It’s a 81% serum based concealer, with no creasing/caking for 12 hrs.   My Review: I wear concealer literally everyday. I use it mainly as an under-eye concealer, to coverup blemishes, and to brighten/highlight. But with the concealers I’ve used in the past, they tend to feel heavy on my face and start to crease after a few hours of wear. This serum is completely different and I’m in love with it! First off the applicator gives you a pointy end for smaller jobs, and a curved area for bigger jobs. It makes it very easy to apply to different areas. I noticed no smell at all which I prefer. Secondly I noticed how easily blendable it was. I tried with a brush and beauty blender, and personally liked the results of beauty blender better.  Once applied, it felt like I had nothing on. So it was super lightweight and very comfortable. After wearing it all day, I noticed no creasing/caking. I never had to do any touch ups throughout the day which was a relief! I do always use a moisturizer, then primer before applying my makeup, and a setting spray at the end. The color 305N was a perfect match to my skin tone. It’s very buildable and it covered my blemishes perfectly. But my absolute favorite thing about this concealer is that it is serum based, has hyaluronic acid, ceramides, and peptides in it. Because of those ingredients my face felt so hydrated, and smooth. So it’s a mixture between a makeup and skincare item. It is definitely my new favorite concealer and highly recommend it!"

Because it's luminous it can't really be used to cover up zits or other imperfections.  It's pretty much an undereye concealer.  The price is kind of high for strictly an undereye concealer and I am sure there are dupes that are just as good so I most likely would not purchase this again unless it was on sale.

I received the concealer in the shade 330N. Unfortunately, the shade I picked did not match my skin tone. Its very light for my skin tone even as a concealer. To review the product, I still tried using it for few days. I mixed it with my Lancôme foundation to kind of make it match my skin tone. The formula of this concealer is thin yet buildable and very pigmented. You can easily blend it with your fingertips or using a beauty blender or a brush. It’s so easy and blendable almost like a skincare product. The concealer also has this sheer shimmer to it that gives your skin a glow which I really loved it. I mostly only used the concealer for my undereye and some days for my hyperpigmentation around my lips. It’s a very glowy formula so if you are someone who doesn’t like a formula that gives you a glowy finish concealer then probably this concealer is not the product for you. I have combination oily skin in T Zone, so this formula did not affect my skin or make me feel extra oily. It did not crease on me or set into my lines. This concealer is worth 30$ for product you receive. Apart from the shade not matching my skin tone II really loved this concealer and loved the formula and would recommend this product to anyone who’s looking for a new concealer."

It's a very glowy formula so if you don't like glow or have oily skin  you may not like the finish at all.  It lasted my entire evening without being set.  That's about 6+hours.

I picked a color that would work great for me in the summer but since my tan has faded, it's entirely too dark, so no makeup tutorial is coming now. 😭 However, I still tried it out and will base my review on that... It claims to be a multi-use, serum infused medium buildable coverage concealer with up to 24hr hydration and natural soft glow finish. It is a hydrating concealer. The coverage felt more light to medium, even though a little goes a long way. And when I say a little goes a long way, I mean it. I put on the tiniest dab, just to see how it would apply and it covered a very large area. The container is also much larger than I expected and considering how little you need to use, I would say it's well worth the $30 price point. Like I said in the beginning, I am so bummed I got the wrong color- but that's totally my own fault. I really like the way it applies and I like the finish, it's especially nice for dry skin like mine."

This blends out beautifully and leaves a very skin-like radiant glow. Coverage is medium but glowy in a very flattering way. I didn’t notice any shimmer at all - just a youthful, brightening effect. This wore very well on me both on full makeup days and lighter fresh skinned days. Great for under eyes if you have dark circles or bags. I have mature, normal to slightly dry skin and got along great with this."

I definitely use this as a “highlight foundation” meaning I use this as a foundation in my highlight areas. It definitely goes you a soft glow, a your skin but better finish. I think it’s great for the price point and would definitely recommend.  One “con” but isn’t really a con for me, is if you have oily skin, after a good 6 hrs you must blot your face because baby that glow will look like high shine after 6 hrs lol and it definitely creases long before 12 hrs but it’s nothing insane."
