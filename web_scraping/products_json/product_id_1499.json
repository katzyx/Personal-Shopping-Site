I was hoping this would be similar but it does absolutely nothing for me and feels heavy and oily and by the end of the day I am worse off for using it because my makeup feels like it just easily lifts off with a touch. When I don't use it - my makeup lasts longer and looks fresher. Wish I could return this."

It helps to make your makeup go on easily, stay fresh, and last longer. It's a silicone based formula and I love using it when I want my makeup to last all day & you can also wear it alone too. I little goes a long way, you really can stretch this formula to cover more of your skin. It's an antioxidant blend with vitamins A&E, grapeseed extract, and green tea. Im a big fan of this primer and I think if you try it yourself you will see why Its their number one selling primer."

It's the perfect base for foundation, fills in pores, fine lines, helps with the longevity of foundation and makes my skin look great overall. Oh and it knocks off 10 years instantly...what more can I say! I apply 1-2 minutes before foundation as this gives it a chance to settle in and work better. When using this I can usually skip the moisturizer totally as this has a slight hydrating effect (but keep in mind my skin is on the oily side anyway). I always get compliments on my skin when I use this which is why I keep returning to it.  My only slight criticism is I would have preferred it to be in a pump dispenser rather than a tube packaging as it's hard to get out the last bit of product when you reach the end of the tube, but aside from that this is a winner for me.    ~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~  (My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)  1.
