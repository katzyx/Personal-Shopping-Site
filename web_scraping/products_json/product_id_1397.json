This layers nicely over foundation but I especially like it for very light/no-makeup days where I just want to give my face a little boost. I often wear the Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood Flawless Filter and I found this very comparable in wear and texture (sans any tint from Saie), by the end of the day it's still very much in-tact and without piling (my skin is on the more dry side). The rose fragrance is a bit strong when initially applied, but I liked it!"

I like how lightweight and gel-like it feels. It doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019m caking on layers of makeup on top of it. I like that I can use it in so many ways and change up how I apply it. I like to apply onto my skin on really good skin days and it gives me more lively and healthy looking. I also will apply as a primer with makeup over or by mixing in with my foundation. I actually wanted to apply more product than I thought I would because it\u2019s so light weight and I wanted it more of the warmglow to shine through my skin.

First off, you don\u2019t even have to mix it with a moisturizer if you don\u2019t want to.
