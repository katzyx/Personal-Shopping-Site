I have very long hair that usually has trouble getting any volume and this waver gives me volume like you wouldn't believe. Some people say the buttons are in a weird spot and they keep turning the thing off... I thought the same thing until I realized it has a locking feature if you hold down the temperature button when you get it to the temp you want. Boom. Problem solved. After I realized how much I love this waver I bought a second one because I want to make sure I have another on hand, should this one ever stop working. 100% I would recommend this to anyone who wants beachy waves with lots of volume."

As a mom to a 1 year old, it's made my life so much easier and so much faster to get ready. + it's extremely easy to use. It curls quick, it heats up fast, stays hot, and is very easy to maneuver. I need every Bondi Boost Hair tool after trying this one!"
