This product is a game-changer for anyone with curly, coily, or tight-textured hair.  Firstly, the texture of the leave-in conditioner is rich and creamy, making it easy to apply evenly throughout my hair. It provides excellent slip, which makes detangling a breeze. I love that itu2019s packed with nourishing ingredients like jojoba oil, honey, and aloe vera. These ingredients work together to deeply moisturize and strengthen my hair, leaving it feeling soft and manageable.  The fragrance is subtle and pleasant, not overpowering at all, which is a big plus for me. It has a light, sweet scent that lingers just enough without being overwhelming.  One of the standout features of this leave-in conditioner is its ability to define and enhance my natural curls. After applying, my curls are more defined and less frizzy, with a healthy shine. It also provides great hold without making my hair feel crunchy or weighed down.  Another thing I appreciate about Pattern is their commitment to being cruelty-free and using high-quality, safe ingredients. Itu2019s great to know that Iu2019m using a product thatu2019s not only good for my hair but also ethically produced.  Overall, the Pattern Leave-In Conditioner Latte has exceeded my expectations. Itu2019s an essential part of my hair care routine now, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to improve the health and appearance of their natural hair.  Feel free to adjust any part of the review to better fit your personal experience or preferences!"

It also provides great hold without making my hair feel crunchy or weighed down.  Another thing I appreciate about Pattern is their commitment to being cruelty-free and using high-quality, safe ingredients. Itu2019s great to know that Iu2019m using a product thatu2019s not only good for my hair but also ethically produced.  Overall, the Pattern Leave-In Conditioner Latte has exceeded my expectations. Itu2019s an essential part of my hair care routine now, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to improve the health and appearance of their natural hair.  Feel free to adjust any part of the review to better fit your personal experience or preferences!"

It spreads evenly and beautifully, but most importantly it helps my hair clump into larger curls. Thatu2019s a harder one for me. I often struggle with stringy thinner curls.  - This is the best part and why it will continue to be my daily go-to. On its own , it not only helps form my curls, but they are soft!! I canu2019t stand when they feel sticky and weighed down.  A little bit of extra bonus in my world. Pattern is a cruelty, free company.  The leave in is also free of parabens, SLS/SLES, cyclic silicones and phthalates.  I love many products I try, but for my hair, this one is a Holy Grail!"

My scalp area where about an inch of my roots are gets pretty oily but all the rest is SUPER dry and dehydrated & it also gets matted and tangled very easy. I decided to give this leave-in conditioner from Pattern Beauty a try and I'm so ecstatic that is was AMAZING! I usually do a leave-in conditioner as the last step in my hair care routine after I've washed and conditioned my hair or I'll throw in some on the days where my hair feels way more dehydrated than usual. I totally recommend this Pattern Beauty leave-in conditioner for everyone ESPECIALLY for my girls who have dry, dehydrated wavy or curly hair. I usually try to stay away from celebrities brands because in all complete honesty they are always way to overpriced and not very good but Tracy Ellis Ross outdid herself with Pattern Beauty because not only is it amazing but it's also a pretty affordable brand as well. This product is scented but I LOVE the smell but for those looking for unscented products this product probably isn't for you."

However, I donu2019t think leave-in conditioner is an appropriate description, I think it helps with frizz and softness so maybe styling cream? It doesnu2019t make my hair easier to detangle at all which is a big reason why I need a leave-in before styling products. I have to use a different leave-in conditioner (Moroccan oil all-in-one) before this one to detangle my hair (even though I detangle and brush it out in the shower with conditioner). I was hoping to replace my nearly-empty Moroccan oil brand one for this one, but it seems Iu2019ll have to replenish it for this purpose. Unfortunately I already use and love the amika styling cream (and have a nearly-full bottle) so I fear this product wonu2019t be much use for me."

I donu2019t mean to sound over dramatic but Iu2019m honestly sooo happy I gave this leave-in conditioner a try. After just the first use, I felt a noticeable difference in my hair post wash and after styling. It felt so moisturized, healthy and soft. And I then did a twistout which was my BEST results in months! I havenu2019t stopped using it since I got it. & I also added another pattern product to the mix.  Iu2019ve heard some say itu2019s too thick and heavy for their hair but I think thatu2019s exactly what my always dry, unhealthy and thirsty coils needed. I have maybe 4B/3C mixed hair. I have 4 curl batter a in my head naturally and I think it works so well for me. Itu2019s soft, looks good and feels amazing.   Iu2019m definitely going to go out and buy a bunch more and make it a washday staple. Iu2019m just so happy to finally have something that works!"

It smells like the processing of a perm.    It also contains amodimethicone, which is a silicone-based polymer. It is pretty far down the ingredients list, but I try to avoid using silicones in my hair because I do not use shampoo often. I actually missed the Amodimethicone when I scanned the ingredients in the store. Otherwise, I would not have purchased.   I did have pretty nice curl definition, so I gave it two stars. I do like the Pattern Beauty Heavy Conditioner and Treatment Mask. I purchased the Intensive Conditioner, but I havenu2019t used it yet."

I didnt have much luck with her intensive conditioner and I have low porosity hair. it took more work to work in and the result was okay.   I dont know much about the styling products but I've seen positive results. I also have not tried the shampoo because I have my own two favorites (camille rose ginger and sienna naturals shampoo for anyone wondering).   out of her products I love the treatment, edge control, and this leave in conditioner. I'd say this should be the first buy.   hope this helps anyone :)"

This leave in cream contains more occlusives to help prevent frizz while moisturizing your curls.  I highly recommend you try this if you have dry curls that suffer from frizz.

This brand is known to celebrate and specialize in curly,coil and textured hair. My hair is very thin and dry with natural curls I never know what to do with. There is a light floral scent nothing overwhelming just fresh. This is a a leave in conditioner. It is a very thick formula so a little goes a long way. It doesnu2019t leave your hair feeling greedy or weighed down. It great they produced a formula that actually makes your hair feel free, what I mean is it controlled my curls so they were not frizzy but soft and bouncy. My hair felt light and not weighted down. This is a great formula and i recommend if you have frizzy out of control curls give it a try. Thank you for choosing me to use and review your u201cHoly Grailu201d leave in conditioner."

They both have 3a-3b curl pattern and they used to use 100% jojoba oil, The Ordinary argan oil and the castor oil leave in from Shea Moisture. Now the leave in routine(all Pattern products) is the jojoba blend, argan blend and the jumbo leave in conditioner; then the curls just spring up and shine from the weightless hydration. Also my husband used to get devacurl(no hair loss just felt like he wanted more hydration with less weight) and he liked them somewhat but realized their products weren't really doing it for his curls for the price point but this brand is worth every penny!"
