I have very sensitive skin, so sometimes I try out something new, and I have horrible reactions and need time to calm my skin back down. Luckily, this has been wonderful! I chose late last year to get back into a good skin routine, so I started with this serum and the Pink Cloud cleanser. In the fall, I noticed this serum was enough most days as my main moisturizer for day, but now that it's winter, I'm using some additional products since I have naturally very dry and sensitive skin. This makes my skin feel soft, plump, and dewy, without feeling tacky. I already bought my second bottle to keep up my routine. If you have dry and sensitive skin, I highly recommend giving this product a chance."

I have chemical allergies-- many other products cause skin irritations, trigger asthma and/or migraine; this one is problem-free.  Also noticeably, REMARKABLY hygroscopic!  I use it every night, and sometimes won't even top with a moisturizer; my face is always hydrated in the morning (previously, always dry).    After applying, before I fall asleep, it can become a bit sticky to the touch, but that just reminds me not to touch my face.  This product attracts ambient humidity like nothing I've worn before.    Following the most stressful 3 months of my life (while wearing an N95 all day everyday):  the dehydration/ fine lines around my mouth are becoming less apparent; my healthy pores look smaller; clogged pores are diminishing...    I don't write many reviews, but Herbivore's Bakuchiol is really good, and I'm AMAZED by the hydration from Cloud Jelly!"

Iu2019ve tried lots of hyaluronic acid serums, plumping serums etc and this one isnu2019t bad. For me it works well, hydrates, not oily, no real smell to it, and it does in fact plump the skin. However, Iu2019ve been using it for a month (I give all the products I try 30 consecutive days) to see if there is benefit and the answer is yes. This will hydrate your skin and make it soft plump and so on. It is however a very small amount for the price and using it AM and PM as recommended it barely lasted me the full 30 days. Iu2019m not fully sold on this because I feel there are other products that produce just as well results if not BETTER, for less money and more product. A good example is the jumbo plum plump from glow recipe. So for me it wonu2019t be a repurchase because I feel there are others that do better"

All I got was an email with them beating around the bush and would not even answer the simple question.  The cream was the same as well. I did not see any listing for fragrance so  that is why I gave it a try.  Terrible customer service.   I will never buy from this line again.  Just a simple question so itu2019s a simple answer.

Which is great because I prefer using multiple lighter, quick absorbing moisturizing products in the morning so I can get out of the door quickly. It also doesn't irritate my dry, sensitive skin or have much of a scent. I don't feel it plumps up my skin, but it moisturizes and my skin is soft after application. Asethically, it has a really fun liquid jelly like texture and I like that its pink. I'm giving it 4 stars because it does exactly what it says it will and it suits my needs better than other hyaluronic acids I've tried (absorbs faster and better than other hyaluronic acids I've tried and it has a nice texture), but it's expensive."

However, since that brand isnu2019t Clean at Sephora, I am always on the hunt for a good alternative. I want something that helps reduce the lines on my forehead, fills out texture on my cheeks and visibly keeps me hydrated underneath makeup all day. This product initially did those things. Where I started to wane on my instant love of the Cloud Jelly, was in the overall timeline of the product.   Collagen is best absorbed internally. It can sit on the surface of your skin but without adequate ways to keep the product penetrating into the surface, it will just evaporate. This product did not last a full 12 hours under a full face of makeup. I have tried it without makeup, and it doesnu2019t withstand a full day this way either. I think itu2019s a great immediate-gratification, surface-level skincare product. Would I purchase again? If I wanted something that would help hydrate my skin and physically reduce texture for about 5 hours? Yes. Otherwise the hunt continues for something better. The price point did not yield the promise I wanted it to."

Snow mushroom is an excellent substitute that also binds water, thereby acting as a humectant. This was a smart release given that some people struggle with hyaluronic acid based products, and yes - this is free of all forms of HA.  Like all of Herbivore's products, the texture is lovely - a bit thicker initially but absorbs rapidly into skin. The smell is light and natural, and it dissipates quickly. Skin feels hydrated and smooth after use, and the thicker nature of this product seems to leave skin also looking a bit more like glass skin. I will say this might be too much for oily skin types, but I think dry to normal will love the end result.  As per usual, I appreciate the glass bottle. Not only is it beautiful, but I appreciate that it is less damaging to our planet than plastic. The price is also extremely reasonable given how a little goes a long way and glass packaged, clean products tend to cost much more. Herbivore tends to be great at striking a fair balance, and I'd say they have yet another hit in this product!"

I love that it also contains strawberry extract so I get some extra Vitamin C without using a different product. It doesnu2019t have an overpowering scent and it doesnu2019t irritate my skin either.

            "review_text": "This serum has a lightweight, watery gel texture that instantly hydrates and feels cooling on the skin. It absorbs quickly, but does feel a little tacky, though I personally don't mind as I always layer another serum or moisture on top. There is a very light natural scent, though according the ingredients list, no fragrances were added. My dry skin appreciates its soothing and hydrating properties.   Gifted by Herbivore, but opinions are my own."
