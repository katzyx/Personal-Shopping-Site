This was my first time using Vitamin C products, so I tested it first, and I had no adverse reaction.  I like the citrus scent and consistency of all the products. My skin absorbs the serum well. My favorite is the eye cream, which I feel is a good base for my concealer.   The instructions also advise you to wear sunscreen along with the products, but that's standard for Vitamin C too."

Anyway, I started using the banana bright primer under makeup and then at night time I did the eye cream and moisturizer. I had the most severe reaction around my eyes, down my neck - it felt like I was burnt and then it turned into really dry skin almost like after a sunburn. I have NEVER reacted this way to any product that is heavy on the vitamin c such as the Kat Burki Serum and I don't often use moisturizers like this one so it shouldn't have taken me so long to figure out which product was doing this. I would post a photo but honestly it was disgusting and I think I'll have scarring on my neck as a result. I know I have dry, sensitive skin but it's strange for me to break out and I don't think it's worth anyone taking the risk for this product. so disappointing and unnerving. I won't be straying from my regulars anymore. this product needs to go!"

I ran to Sephora to get some. A few weeks  now Iu2019ve noticed my skin is tighter, glowing and so much more youthful again. For reference I am 52 years old.

Tbh, I believe this is the only brand from whom I seen an immediate effect, so far.  I used this pack for the first time today, and I love the feeling and smell it has. I was welcomed with a clean orange smell, then had a second welcome of freshness all over my face, quite a good good morning handsome if you ask me.  I'm not sure what a brightening effect should be but, we're now 30mins after its usage and the freshness is still slowly fading away. I got used to the orange smell and/or it's not present anymore cuz I don't smell it no more. The face is still glowy which is an effect I enjoy, it's not for everyone to have that lightly wet glowy/reflecting face look but me I love it. It doesn't look 'oily/dirty/sweaty' as some could fear a lightly wet effect could look like, but I could be biased since I know it's because of that product. On the touch, still 30 mins later, the skin is still a bit sticky but if I applied too much or if my skin simply absorbs slower than other... I don't know. Could be my mistake, or could be the product is made that way. The product is supposed to leave the skin looking healthier, that is indeed the case. The redness is still present but the skin tone still looks more even that it did before as the few whiter spots I have are now less appearant amongst the rest of my complexion. It does hydrate my skin, I have a sensible skin and vitamin c products are usually a no no for me, but didn't felt any tingling or burning sensation like most vitamin c products will do to me. Didn't had any weird/bad sensation, from the beginning to its end, it only felt good and refreshing.  So far so good, even if no effect would be present, I would still use it for how it feels and how it smells."
