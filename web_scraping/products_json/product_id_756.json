I've had no issues with breakouts, no white cast (granted, I'm a ghost), and it has no real scent to be bothered by. It applies as a lotion, very smooth, no tacky, sticky, or greasy residue. I wear both an oil-based serum and thicker moisturizer under this. No pilling or separation. Makeup wears beautifully on it. And then there's the GLOW: like, glassy, lit-from-within glow. I'm not talking about the grease-stain that some sunscreens turn you into. This isn't oily, it's not greasy, it doesn't start melting off your face in half an hour... it leaves the prettiest, healthiest glow, and if you top it off with a highlighter, you'll be beaming like a goddess all freaking day. And at no point in that day, will it dry you out. Truly lovely. 100% recommend."

This leaves 0 white cast, hydrates + plumps my skin, gives the most beautiful glow, sinks in quickly, and never pills!! This is one of those i can't believe it's real kind of products. It's the only thing i want to use to prime my face now. I am a medium to full coverage girlie and this wears so freaking beautifully under my foundation. It makes everything look so radiant but not greasy! The photo attached is with the product on my face before foundation.

I would buy this product again because it is light, and it actually seems like it works with keeping my face moisturized and not dry with spots.  I would definitely recommend because it is 2 in 1 and has a light feeling that is not overbearing. I sometimes have sensitive skin and this did not irritate my skin at all.

The product it self does not make me more oily, I think it just makes me feel more dewy which I think is the point of this product. I love that its 50+SPF and has pollution protection because I live in a big city and its always sunny. It has Pro-Vitamin B5 as well as Hyaluronic Acid which is a plus, its like getting 2 or 3 products in one! I don't use liquid make up so I will use this IT sunshine sunscreen for days that I am not wearing make up because it does give a good glow but for the days that I wear make up, I will continue to use the supergoop facial sunscreen because it has a more powder feel that I prefer under my makeup."

It remained fairly dewey for the 20 minutes I let it soak in before applying makeup. It never fully sank in, but didnu2019t remain as dewey as upon initial application. This sunscreen does not work for me. Two hours after applying makeup my face looked so greasy. My foundation/skin tints felt heavy and I had that I need to wash my face feeling. Possibly it doesnu2019t agree with my skin care, primer, or foundations or maybe the formula is just too heavy for me. Whatever the reason, this is a fail for me and I will be using my Korean sunscreen."

Very happy with this product and would definitely recommend it!"

It wears well alone or under foundation without leaving any white cast. To me this is the most important attribute that a facial sunscreen can tout. Included is a SPF 50 free of oxybenzone. The formulation is oil-free, non-comedogenic, safe for my skin sensitive skin and allergy tested. I initially wore this under my IT COSMETICS foundation because I was going to be working outside. I felt safe knowing that my SPF was layered and my face didn't feel heavy or greasy. Instead it felt moisturized, protected and my makeup looked great. Another important factor is my eyes didn't burn or itch from the sunscreen. Even when I was sweating, I didn't feel any product run into my eyes and cause burning/tearing. This has been the most innovative beauty product that I've tried so far this year and I'm impressed. This is definitely going to be a staple in my skincare and beauty routine going forward."

It left my skin feeling really soft. I had no issues with it causing blemishes. It didn't flake. My skin was smoother as well. I was not impressed with it as a primer. I definitely think you need to use a separate primer because it made my makeup slip off. Like blowing your nose, it left a lot of makeup on the tissue. Definitely needed a setting spray as well. I think it's great if you aren't wearing makeup though. That's my reasoning for the 4 stars."

I received my serum sunscreen just in time to leave for a ski trip. Knowing how important it is to use sunscreen on the slopes, and temporarily being on a medication that increased my sun sensitivity significantly, I knew I had the perfect opportunity to try this product out. It protected my skin completely. I feel like the hyaluronic acid helped my skin stay hydrated when the winds picked up and hard snow was blowing in my face. It is not greasy feeling at all; it is relatively thin and absorbs right in, leaving no white cast. The scent is what I'd describe as a very light sunscreen scent. I have continued to use this product as a stand-alone sunscreen (I love the high SPF of 50), though it is also a primer (I just don't wear foundation most days). It has truly been non-comedogenic for my face, and that's something I have struggled with in facial products. With summer approaching here in the Southern California sunshine, I will continue to use this confidently on beach and pool days."

I can confidently recommend this to anyone who likes cutting down on the number of products they use in the morning, enjoys a dewy finish, hates a white cast and has drier skin.

And while I've had other facial sunscreens cause my eyes to sting this one did not do that whatsoever.  There are a couple of possible negatives, but the verdict is still out on those...it seems this may make my skin dry, but maybe I need to add an extra moisturizer over this one and I'm afraid this could make me break out but so far has not."

This is a fast-absorbing, thin lotion that I am proud to use for daytime, and I also use it at nighttime (despite the need for the high SPF).  My fine lines and wrinkles are plumped out of my face skin in less than five minutes after application, which is legendary!  I was not able to use this product for long enough to pronounce it the benign of all wrinkles on my face, but its active ingredients tell me that I should (given more time).  I like this particular serum because it works like a very threadbare foundation, which is just what I need and want for my nearly clear skin.  It minimizes the look of my pores and also blurs the look of imperfections in my skin.  It is lightweight and holds makeup beautifully to my skin all day.  I received this product for free in exchange for writing a review.  Thank you for the opportunity!"

I received this product as an incentive from BzzAgent and IT Cosmetics."

Some of my makeup contain sunscreen, but I donu2019t always wear makeup, so this product seemed like a perfect fit  for me. I was thrilled with the ingredients, so not only am I getting sun coverage, but itu2019s benefiting me in other ways. I love that it contains hyaluronic acid. And that it contains 50 SPF. The packaging is cute, but not too much. The lotion itself is very lightweight, and more like what youu2019d expect from a moisturizer than a sunscreen as it is much thinner and smoother. It absorbs very quickly and blends right in without any white cream showing. It is very lightly scented, and a little goes a long way. I have been using it for about 2 weeks and love the way it feels. My makeup layers over it well and I have spent plenty of time outside for work without burning at all. This is definitely a new step in my daily skincare routine!"

I found filling in my brows, eyes and applying blush to be easier since my skin was well moisturized and smooth. I didn't try for any dramatic looks so I can't advise on Hello Sunshine serums performance there.   prior to applying Hello Sunshine, I washed my skin, pat dried my skin, and applied my typical face cream and waited a bit for it to soak in.   I've yet to try the serum without my typical face cream so I can't say what it would feel like. regardless, I strongly recommend introducing Hello Sunshine to everyone who has dry skin, even moderately dry/combo."

As someone with eczema, I often struggle to find skincare products that don't irritate my sensitive skin. Additionally, as a person of color, it's a challenge to find products that don't leave my skin looking greasy or overly dry. This product manages to meet both of these needs effectively.  Firstly, the formula is gentle on the skin. It's hydrating without being too heavy or oily, which is a major win for anyone with eczema. I've noticed that it doesn't trigger any flare-ups or discomfort, which is a relief. It's so rare to find a product that feels like it's truly made with sensitive skin in mind.  Secondly, the product works well with my skin tone. It doesn't leave any unsightly greasy sheen, nor does it strip my skin of moisture, leaving it dry. This balance is crucial for maintaining healthy-looking skin that feels as good as it looks. The texture of the product is just right for everyday use, and it absorbs nicely, leaving a smooth, comfortable finish.  Overall, I give this product a thumbs up for both its gentleness on sensitive skin and its effectiveness in providing the right kind of hydration for people of color. It's comforting to find a product that I can rely on daily, which caters to my specific skin concerns without causing any additional problems. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who shares similar skin issues or concerns, as it's been a fantastic addition to my skincare routine."

With naturally oily skin, finding a sunscreen that moisturizes without adding to the oiliness is a challenge, but this product does just that. Its inclusion of pro-vitamin B5 and hyaluronic acid is a major plus for skin health, and the added benefit of serving as a primer enhances its value. Despite initially feeling slightly sticky upon application, this sensation dissipates over time. I was relieved to find that it doesn't leave a white cast, and instead, it blends seamlessly, leaving my skin with a radiant glow. Unlike many sunscreens with strong scents and heavy textures that tend to pill up, this sunscreen is refreshingly light and leaves a beautiful glowy finish. Plus, it plays well under makeup, making it a standout addition to my skincare routine."

Upon using the product it smelled just like other sunscreens just not as strong. it was white with a little hint of some yellow to it however, it dried down completely clear, no white, casting to my skin. Initially, as it was absorbing into the skin, it will look slightly greasy however, in a couple seconds it absorbs, and thereu2019s no greasiness there whatsoever. The product is quite thin so be careful when opening the lid. Overall, I was actually quite impressed with this sunscreen. I do not know if I would use this as a primer just because after a while of wearing it, it does to look greasy. This is not a product that I would purchase on my own.

This sunscreen has a runny consistency that is easy to spread; while it initially feels slightly greasy, it eventually dries to a natural finish with a fresh fragrance that's apparent upon initial application and lingers for a while. While I wouldn't say it feels like nothing, it does feel lightweight because it really is invisible and doesn't remain sticky or shiny after it settles on the skin. As it's true for most sunscreens, you have to apply an adequate/generous amount to get the SPF listed on the label, which means that I'll probably go through this 1.69 oz. squeeze tube quickly. Then again, it's small enough to throw in your bag and take with you when you need to reapply, so the small size could be a positive for you.   I used this under makeup and can see how this can be considered a primer, but that's mostly because it hydrates skin, doesn't pill, and doesn't interfere with foundation, but I wouldn't say it makes pores look smaller or help makeup last longer. I'd love this sunscreen if it didn't have such a strong fragrance, but think it's a nice option for someone looking for a chemical-based sunscreen with no white cast."

It lives up to its claims - it does not leave a white cast, it's hydrating, and a great primer for makeup. I have experienced pilling with similar products, but I have tested this with many different skincare and makeup combinations and have not experienced any pilling whatsoever. I have combination-oily skin and can get a bit shiny in my t-zone when using this product, but it is something I can adjust for in my skin prep and makeup application, so I have not experienced any issues with this. If your skin type is oily, I'd recommend using this after cleansing and toning without moisturizer as this will be hydrating enough for your needs.   This SPF is super lightweight and sinks in quickly which I love and leaves a beautiful glow when worn on its own. It does include a light fragrance which I think smells nice and hasn't caused me any irritation, but if you are looking for a fragrance-free option, you'll want to be mindful of that. Overall, I really enjoyed it and would repurchase!"

While I don't have sensitive skin, I was worried about any potential film or residue it would leave on my face or that would smear when I applied my makeup. I was pleased to see that not only does the sunscreen serum go on super lightweight, but you can't tell I have on any type of moisturizer when I follow my regular makeup routine. This product is also unscented so it won't bother anybody that's sensitive to smells. Definitely a must buy and I love the sleek non-bulky container too!"

I've used it for the past few days and it's non-greasy without leaving a white cast. Love that it's SPF 50 because I'm always looking for sunscreens with a higher SPF.

I would prefer if it was unscented as the scent it gives off a strong department store perfume counter vibe and honestly I don't like a scented facial sunscreen. It is absolutely invisible so I will give it credit for that aspect! I would use purely for sun protection if I didn't have any other options but wouldn't seek it out for myself.

So much so- I'm able to walk out of the house without applying a facial moisturizer! It leaves a lit within glow without looking like a shimmering- glitter mess. It doesn't look greasy like most sunscreens. It does have a SLIGHT tacky feeling after dry down. Perfect for priming the skin for makeup. My most favorite part of the product is the HYDRATION!!! I'm incredibly soft even 18 hours after initial application. A lil tip... I'll apply it to my hands prior to getting into the car to help protect my hands while driving.
