I typically use a hair mousse for braid out which are not in the least bit moisturizing but they provide a certain about of hold and that's important to me. I purchased this product, the custard , and the mousse from traces brand and I have to say the mousse is the best, then the cream, and if you have type 4 hair you can do without the custard tbh. This product is moisturizing and you get a decent amount of it but that's about it. the braid out won't last but the moisture will and so I would say probably paired with the mousse it would work but I would only suggest risking that combo if the products are on sale otherwise go to sally beauty and use their cheaper selection of mousse with this cream."

This leaves my hair looking fresher longer, without scalp buildup. I leave off a star for the fragrance becauseu2026this ainu2019t Palo Santo. The fragrance name is total bruja bait, and yes, I fell for it. This is a generic product fragrance that isnu2019t too strong, kinda citrusy clean smell.

This time I got it in the Palo Santo scent. It smells so good! Iu2019m usually sensitive to a lot of new fragrances, but this one doesnu2019t trigger me at all which is great. I donu2019t smell a lot of mint, but I do get the woody and citrusy smell which is pleasant."

I love how this gives me a sleek look when styling without making my hair look crispy or dried out. Infact, the moisture in this formula is unreal, it makes my hair feel so much softer without making it oily or causing build up. It actually made our hair feel so much softer while still providing the hold we needed to maintain the style. Not to mention the fragrance is light (not overpowering) yet heavenly. Ifeel like finding curly haired products that actually work for my hair is almost impossible so when I find something that really works Iu2019m all in!

Before you mix any products make sure to test them to avoid the dreaded clumping of products. When I used the product I liked the texture it feels creamy and not watery. I tested my products by mixing them in my hand to make sure it does not clump. I did not get the Pattern gel which I most likely will get. I had to try a couple of gels and found the right mix. I sectioned my hair and brushed the pattern styling cream in and my hair loved it. The curls were popping moisturized and defined. Better than the cheaper products I normally buy. Quality is definitely there."

It doesn't build up on my hair or make it feel greasy. It gives the perfect amount of conditioning for you to add whatever products you need to add on top of it. Of course, I don't actually use it for styling... I imagine I'd want a product with more hold for that. But as a first step after washing, it's my new go-to. I started with the travel size and now I just refill the smaller jar from the full-size jar I upgraded to. Perfect for saving space in the bathroom or dropping into a carry-on."
