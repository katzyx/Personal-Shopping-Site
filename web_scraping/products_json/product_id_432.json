This serum, applied after drying my hair, keeps my hair looking smooth and shiny and free of frizz, and is super lightweight. Iu2019m not really using it for hold necessarily, but I do find that my hair maintains a smooth appearance for the duration of the day after Iu2019ve applied it. Iu2019m pretty impressed!

And I love the way you dispense the hair serum and how the tube of product can be taken out, so cool. The texture is light and creamy,  and easy to run through my hair. It smells super good,  has floral and woodsy notes, and the bergamot really comes through. It makes my hair smell incredible all day long. My hair feel very smooth and soft after I apply it, and gives it a beautiful shine. It makes my curls more defined, bouncy, and luscious. The serum has helped tremendously with reducing my frizz and flyaways, and just giving my hair an overall healthier feel and look. I'm loving this hair serum and use it often. Will definitely buy it again. I received this product complimentary from Dyson."
