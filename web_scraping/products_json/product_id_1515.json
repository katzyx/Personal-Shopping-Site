It is so moisturizing and creamy that it kept my skin super soft on vacation when I had to shower multiple times a day because of the heat. The cream itself is pretty good and smells super nice but I should have known myself better and find that I don't like putting fragranced moisturizer on my body most of the time so I haven't used much of it. Just be aware of your preferences.  The spray of course smells nice but I don't wear fragrance too often and when I do, I find it can fade pretty quickly which can be good or bad depending on preferences.  Final thoughts: out of the products I would pick up the shower gel again but skip on the rest due to my preferences."

For the shower cream gel, I only smelled it when I open the cap. As I showered, I left it a couple of minutes and the smell would go away after rinsing and drying myself. I even tried putting the mist right away when I dried myself the mist does not  last. Alone itself the mist would last me like 10min max and it was gone.THIS company has better versions  of mists  that do last , I really really wanted to try the Brazilian bum bum cream as I was reading reviews of customers that the product did  work on them. There was not a timeframe That people would say it long it took to see results on them, but everyone is different. this little 1.7ounce so far since I purchased it. I haven't seen any help. I might have to buy the full 8 oz for $44  to see how long will it take, but I don't think I would purchase any of these again. I am not a Sephora employee nor I receive a promotion for this. It's  just my honest opinion"
