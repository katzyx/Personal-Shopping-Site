It lost all day in the coverage is fantastic. I like the fact that you squeeze it out of the tube not using a doe foot applicator. It's much more sanitary this way. One tube can literally last over 2 years! I use it under my eyes in the inner Corners as my eyes are a little bit deep set. I use it on my nose and blend outwards. A little dot on my chin and it's fantastic. You have to remember to keep blending. The warmth from your finger will melt it into your skin nicely. If you're finding a cakey it's because you have not warmed it up on the back of your hand and you have not kept blending it until it becomes one with your skin. Honestly it's such a good concealer"

It looked AWFUL even my fiance was like u201cooo yeh I see what you meanu201d.   Desperately in Sephora I hunted for a u201cwaterproofu201d concealer. Found this one and it wasnu2019t quite as light of a shade as Iu2019d like but I bought it. I opened it and took a teeeeeny amount and just pressed it with my finger under my eye over the broken apart bare area andu2026 GURL it not only covered it but it looked flawless for about 6 hours after WITHOUT setting it with powder. My eye continued to leak throughout the evening as well and it didnu2019t budge!! So, this has become my absolute holy grail ride or die bestie now.   The photo is after I touched it up, after 6 hours on at the end of the night when I got home. You canu2019t even tell!!"

It sounds like a lot of work but I get the best results using it this way, and much less creasing. Because you need SO little, it lasts FOREVER. Overall, I appreciate the skin care/anti aging properties, and would repurchase. It really depends on how much effort you want to put into the application process, because it's more work than the average concealer, but definitely looks and performs better."

I love the creamy consistency with just the right amount of thickness for great coverage.
