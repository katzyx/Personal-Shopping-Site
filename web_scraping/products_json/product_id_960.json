I'll try to use it up but I wouldn't buy it again, it doesn't make enough difference to justify the price."

Ugh, I can only imagine how much lip product I have eaten over the years, but I scarily digress. But for that very reason, I have switched to clean products just to keep my overactive mind at bay.  I was using the ever popular Laneige lip mask, but really wasn't all that impressed with it considering its cost. This overnight plumping mask, mind you, is small and I initially questioned how much product I was actually getting for the price, but my first pot is still going strong and it's been two months maybe (?!)  I actually ended up ordering a second one because I like it so much. Specifically, it gives a slight tingle which I love and feels more luxurious on the lips than other lip masks and balms. If I don't toss and turn too much during the night, I usually still have some on even when I wake up.  I use this in conjunction with the Dr. Gross lipware pro device. Both of which I purchased with my own money and currently use."

I saw a lot of reviews expecting extreme plumping and I have to be honest u2013 the OG lip pluming glosses just were giving everyone an allergic reaction and marketing it as plumping. It does plump your lips very lightly, I do see a slight difference in the hydration of my lips but it isn't going to increase your lip size overnight. Maybe the marketing needs to be more clear about it but if people weren't expecting a transformation from this product it would be 5 stars across the board. Don't care, will die on the hill that this gloss is fantastic and the only product I have ever scraped the pot clean and owned multiple of."

Every year when winter hit, my lips would get dry and flaky, and nothing was ever a long term fix... until I found this product. I used to have to exfoliate, moisturize, and seriously up my hydration for at least two weeks to recover.  I tried this lip mask and my lips not only recovered, but I have not had dryness since. Its been over a year and I'm halfway through my second pot. I also used to experience loss of fullness if I had a poor hydration day and my lips would be thinner than usual the next morning. Now I don't experience that either.   I think its worth a try at the very least!"

I enjoy the feel on my lips as it is nice and smooth, not too waxy, not too slippery. It stays on my lips throughout the night and doesn't collect a bunch of hair (I have pets), which is important. It also has a cooling effect, and I feel the plumping is more than both the balm and the gloss, so it's my favorite formula of the three products. I wish this formula was either in a tube like Summer Fridays or in the chapstick tube like the balm. That would make it an all in one product for me and earn a place in my purse. Regardless, I'll be repurchasing this lip mask and hoping Lawless expands their delivery systems/lip products."

The balm feels nice on the lips and is pleasant to apply, but that's about it. I find it wears off within an hour of application, haven't noticed any real immediate or long-term improvements (been using about a month). Not much plumping with single application either, I think most of the plumping comes from rubbing your lips to apply. I would have returned but felt I'd used too much product and had my fingers in it so I'm keeping and using up. Would not repurchase."

It actually makes my lips feel good all night. Iu2019ve struggled for years just going from lip balm brand to next new lip balm brand. I am so grateful I tried this brand and found the items that work during the day (the tinted balm, the liner, and the gloss) and especially this night mask. I am so excited to put it on each night. I love the tingle but most of all I love how it feels so nourishing and hydrating and not just like a normal balm that sits on top of the lip. This feels like it penetrates and gets under the skin. I cannot ever be without this again."
