            "review_text": "This is my first time trying Drunk Elephant products and I am very happy with this purchase. The products are a nice size to start out with; not too small. My skin has noticeably improved in texture and redness and two stubborn blemishes I did have are quickly going away after only two days of use. My skin is also very soft, something that never happens regardless of the moisturizer I use. The C Firma needs to be mixed before first use, but this is quite easy to do if you follow the instructions on the side of the bottle. When you first open the package it looks like the top of the C-Firma bottle is unattached. Don't freak out, it's not broken! Follow the instructions to mix the product and before trying to reattach the top portion, be sure to remove the thin cardboard strip at the top of the base. I almost missed this, but quickly realized this is what was keeping the top from clicking into place. Once removed, you should be good.  To use the product, turn the top counter-clockwise and the pump will pop up. Turn it clockwise to close it. While it did not happen to me as I'm used to using these types of ingredients, these products may make you break out more at first because it's purging the skin. It will get better, but it has to get worse first. Be patient and enjoy. This is a real review and not incentivized."

Sunday is definitely more hydrating.  u2022 This vit c smells like bananas and is a bit sticky and drippy, I didnu2019t notice any like u201cwow Iu2019m glowingu201d u2022  I really like the serum texture of the b hydra but I honestly havenu2019t noticed any difference in the level of hydration in my face. Still feel kinda dry under there.  u2022 The framboos is very nice as my skin is super smooth and I donu2019t have those small white bumps under my skin that used to plague me. Nice gel texture too.  It was fun to get this kit and try it out but SR kits are a better price point and feel more hydrating for me personally."
