This is ostensibly an indian owned brand and I thought as such teh colours would be better on my skin but geenrally they are too light and don't really show. For them to show, I have to really layer, but then there is a risk of cracking and peeling unlike when they are more sheer. I end up using them as abase colour and then layering a powder on top. But the real issue is, the glass they are in- Almost all of my cosmetics are in glass, so this shouldn't be odd. The day i got this, it gently slid down my sink (weird) and when it got to the bottom, it was so heavy that it shattered my sink as well as itself. So I got a great deal on the makeup, but now I have to pay over 400$ to replace a sink instead of getting my kids christmas presents and the makeup is unusable as the glass is shattered. All into the trash o the first day, and no bathroom sink and all from sliding into it. I have had other products in glass and never this issue. I just sadly cannot recomment.  I do have love for the eyeliner, in a plastic casing!"

It has the same effect for deeper complexions that UD's Space Cowboy and ColourPop's Ritz has for fair-tan complexions. Very blendable and gives a stunning glitter effect without doing TOO much. Great for everyday looks and even work. Can't wait to try other colors. Hopefully they'll come out with bundles soon!"

This stuff is easy to work with and you get a decent amount of time before it dries down. Once i'ts dried, it's flippin' bulletproof. You'll need a makeup removing oil to get it off. I love Kulfi's eyeliner too. Fantastic on the waterline, and you get a good amount. I bought it over a year ago and use it every single day, and still have an inch of product left.

Compared to other wet/textured shadows, I will reach for this far more than the viral space cowboy, for example. Swatch it in store and see for yourself. Kulfi crushed it with this shade. I also picked up bronze brocade. It immediately reminded me of something I once had and loved - the old beloved and discontinued Kosas liquid shadows. If you know you know. If you had globe or copper halo, this is phenomenal replacement!  These are easy to use, no fall out, and the gel texture is unique. Probably one of my favorite beauty purchases this year."

I am a makeup minimalist. I wear skin care and then blush and now this eye shadow to offer a bit more life. I do use a soft brush to smooth out if needed, but that's it. Super smooth to apply, a little goes a long way and the end result is a dream. I am also prone to periorbital and perioral dermatitis and this does not affect it in any way. I will say the price is steep, but it is worth it in my opinion as you should have this a while. If too steep wait until Sephora has a sale or something. You will not regret this purchase though."

I mainly like it on my lower lash line for some extra dimension to my eyes, a little something extra, and it lasts a long time even though Iu2019m oily. On the lids I also love it, but I donu2019t take it past my crease because of the shimmers. Itu2019s very reflective and it gives the u201cwet looku201d if thatu2019s what you like!

Perfect for a one and done. What impressed me most is how dimensional it is on the eyes - the silver sparkles pop against the rich bronze base and give a twinkly look. I'd say the particle size of sparkle is of medium size."

This eyeshadow applied super easily and DID NOT BUDGE all day! I have hooded eyes and I was so surprised that it didn't crease, since most cream eyeshadows end up creasing on me. I think it really helps to pat or tap it onto your eyelids rather than swiping with a brush. Even after being outside in the heat and sweating, this eyeshadow did not budge and lasted all day.  I really love the color as well - it is super dynamic. Within the bronze, there are some small silver sparkles that really catch the light. You can see in my 2 photos with different lighting that it almost looks like a neutral on me in direct bright light, but in more natural light without tons of sunlight pouring it, you can really see the depth of the bronzey color and a bit of the silver sparkles peek through. It works great for an eyeshadow look that can transition from day to night. I definitely recommend trying it out!"

You can blend it to be very thin but it will still have high impact on your eye, and that also helps with their no creasing claim. Lasts all day on your face. I find that blending it out with the finger is better than using a brush, maybe it's the warmth of your finger that helps it melt into the skin. Sitara Sparkles truly is VERY sparkly because of its high glitter content, but that does mean there is significant fallout if you try blending after it dries. If you have sensitive eyes to glitter, be careful with that."

I also used an eyeliner brush to apply this as eyeliner along my upper lash line, and was pleasantly surprised that it lasted all day. This eyeshadow is so creamy and easy to apply because it dries quickly, but not so quickly that you have zero time to blend it in.

I also used an eyeliner brush to apply this as eyeliner along my upper lash line, and was pleasantly surprised that it lasted all day. This eyeshadow is so creamy and easy to apply because it dries quickly, but not so quickly that you have zero time to blend it in.

I can get a good amount of color with one swipe. I wish they would extend the line with more colors!"

I was pleasantly surprised with how well it held up in travel. The design is sturdy and the lid doesn't allow air in. I tried applying it several different ways and ultimately prefer the look obtained with fingers. One note is that you want to make sure to pick up just the tiniest amount of product and build from there. If you grab too much, you'll end up pushing too much product into the corner of the eyes (where it may crease/fall onto your cheeks). Just use a light touch and build if you want more.  I also tried it with a brush and that gives a barely-there appearance. I liked it in some ways, but I do like the color and thus prefer the effect of a finger application.  It wears very well through the day. Surprisingly well, in fact. It won't smudge or crease if you apply it as described above, and it looks great at the end of the day.  Overall, I am very pleased!"

The color is so pretty you can see the red pigment within the sun it reflects silver specks. The eye shadow applies like a cream at first which you can build up the color or make it subtle. I like that it turns into a powder once it sets in the eyelid. I did not notice any creases when I was using the eyeshadow which I really like because a lot of cream shadows leave eyeshadow in the crease and cause a line The eyeshadow feels comfortable on my eyelids and no bad reaction when using it during the day. I did a little touch-up but not too much is needed."

This eyeshadow has such a nice texture - cooling, bouncy, and pigmented where I only need a little bit to cover my eyelid and blend into the crease. It is multidimensional (I only have this shadow on my eyelids) and dries down with enough time to finish blending. Once dry, there was minimal creasing on my hooded eyelids, even without primer at the end of the day (8+ hours). It had just enough shimmer with some micro glitter so I can wear for work, and good for minimal makeup looks. A banger from Kulfi! Hope they come out with more shades.  Excited to try other products from the brand, and amazing that I can now get them at Sephora."

I would even try to use this as a liner or other kind of fun graphic look. This is my first Kulfi product and it may be a gateway drug lol. Gifted by Kulfi."
