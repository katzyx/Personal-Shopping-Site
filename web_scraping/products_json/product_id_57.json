Not even a liquid, pencil or gel eyeliner will last more than maybe 2 hours without beginning to transfer and smudge, and thatu2019s even with setting it as well as priming underneath. Strange, because the rest of my face is extremely dry lol. Anyways, this liquid eyeshadow lasted on me for the entire 8 hour excursion with ZERO creasing. I was shocked. The colour is stunning - itu2019s your standard u201cbronzer shade.u201d Application literally takes 2 minutes tops, including blending time. Maybe 3 if you want it to look super buffed out and smooth. I did not even set it with anything, I simply blended it out with a clean MAC blending brush. I did, however, prime with the NARS eyeshadow primer. I will attach a pictured of my makeup post event :) 10/10 recommend if you decide to splurge on something for yourself this holiday season!"

So fair that Iu2019m translucent. You can see so many of my veins on and around my eyelids. I have yet to find an eye primer or cream shadow that conceals those issues and matches my skintone.   My closest match is the Mac Paint Pot in Painterly. But that product is so heavy looking and still a touch too deep and mauvy. So when I saw this new shade, I had to try it. I really thought this might replace my paint pot. You can tell itu2019s pigmented, but I anticipated a really soft and light neutral brown shade.   So, you can imagine my disappointment when my order arrived, I tried it on, and I saw an orange. It looks like a dark peachy orange on me. Itu2019s substantially darker than what I usually use. I know you might be thinking I should keep it and use it as a base for other shadowsu2014I already have that. I donu2019t need a burden of a product. Iu2019ll 100% be returning. I love the 22m & 67s shade but 18 simply not for me, and likely not for any fair skinned customers. If youu2019re a light or medium skin tone, this will likely be a perfect eye base color. I bet it would be a great highlighting color for deeper complexions."

            "review_text": "I have owned the eye tints across the shade range and in varying formulations. I have to sayu2014this new shimmer shade 67S is the best one I've tried. I previously owned 12S and I found that one to have more of a chunky glitter. This shade has a beautifully milled shimmer that has impact but remains smoothing to the eyelid.   If you were to ask me if you need it, I would ask what your makeup concerns are, if youu2019re someone that owns a lot of makeup and whether or not you enjoy single shadows. I think for the average person, like someone that can count on both hands how many makeup items they have, this is a definite recommendation for a special occasion. I would also recommend the matte formula for someone concerned about their eyeshadow looking too heavy or drying once itu2019s on the eyes. But if you buy a lot of luxury or indie makeup, and youu2019re not into one & done eyeshadows, and you don't have to travel a lot, I would say skip it.   It reminds me a lot of shadows you would find in Pat McGrathu2019s old mothership palettes or the Ethereal Eyes palette (rip) by Makeup by Mario. Itu2019s not as finely milled as the latter though. Its certainly not the same as the UD moondust shadows but it looks equally u201cwet.u201d You could wear it every day, but I personally think this level of glitter should be worn on special occasions. Nothing looks as good as glitter does in low-light environments."

As someone with dry, sensitive skin, finding an eyeshadow that 1) lasts and 2)doesn't dry my eyelids is a struggle, especially as I get older. This is smooth, goes on easy and STAYS on! A bonus feature of this shade in particular is that it also doubles as an excellent primer! I love using this all over and then layering over it with other colours in parts! The price point is a bit of a splurge but I definitely have my eye on purchasing some of the other colour choices and would definitely recommend this to a friend!"

I received the shade 67S-Sparkle, which is described as a bright champagne shimmer, and I agree with that description of the color. The consistency is fairly thin, and you have roughly under a minute before it dries down completely. Once dry, it is pretty much budge proof, however I did find that the shimmer particles could still transfer around- but only if rubbed or disturbed. One of the things I like about this, and many other liquid shadows is that they are really good for achieving those one-and-done looks and are perfect for people who want something quick and easy. Effortless. These shadows come in a few different finishes, and as mentioned above, this shade is a sparkle finish-no glitter chunks, just beautiful, ethereal, shimmering sparkles. I appreciate that the formula doesn't make my eyelids feel tight or look textured while wearing it. You can wear this alone or mix with other shadows-wear it sheered out or opaquer. It would be beautiful for a wedding day, or for just your average, everyday makeup. I want to end by saying that there are other products like this on the market if the price point does not suit you, but if you can afford it, and you're looking for a good liquid eyeshadow, these are an excellent choice. I would absolutely purchase this again and want to try some of the other colors."

The pigmentation is rich and the formula is smooth, making it easy to apply and blend. It truly lives up to its name with long-lasting wear, staying vibrant throughout the day without creasing or fading. The range of colors is also fantastic, offering both bold and neutral shades to suit any look. My only minor critique is that it can feel a bit heavy if layered too much. Nonetheless, it's a solid product and I would definitely recommend it."

As someone who often struggles with irritation from eye makeup, Shade 67s Eye Shimmer has been a total game-changer. It's hypoallergenic and doesn't cause any discomfort or watery eyes, which is a huge relief.  Application & Blendability: Shade 67s spreads effortlessly, whether applied with a brush for a polished look or with fingers for those quick touch-ups. The applicator is versatile, enabling full lid coverage or precise application as an eyeliner. What impresses me most is how the glitter adds sparkle without disrupting the underlying color, maintaining a subtle elegance in every look.  Versatility & Durability: This shimmer is not just easy to apply but also incredibly versatile. It transitions seamlessly from a daytime to a nighttime look. Most notably, it held up impressively during a roller derby matchu2014even without primeru2014without any fading or creasing.  Suitability for Skin Tones: As someone with a fair complexion and green eyes, I find that Shade 67s complements my features beautifully, enhancing the green in my eyes and giving a natural yet striking appearance. This makes it an excellent choice for anyone with similar tones looking for makeup that enhances without overwhelming.  Overall Impression: Shade 67s has replaced all other eye products in my makeup bag. Its blend of simplicity for daily wear and potential for more glamorous looks makes it invaluable. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable, non-irritating eye shimmer that really performs. It is great for the clean girl aesthetic, or pair it up with other products to go for a more glam look."

I was kind of careless how high it went because I usually use my finger or something to lower it and straighten it out. That's what I planned to do with this. But it dried so fast and got kind of tacky that I could not get it off. I even tried rubbing it off. I'm fair skinned so this very light pink very high on my eyes made me look like MIMI from Drew Carey. Eventually my eyes got sore so I waited to get it off. I unfortunately did not like it. But my daughter loves it. I think it  I may have just not liked this color. I just can't afford to find out since these are quite expensive. I've never messed with wet eyeshadow so I'm sure that doesn't help either. I'd say try it because you may love it. I'm giving 4 stars because it stays on very well, the applicator is good, and because my daughter loves it."

I recommend this product. Applicator is great and the bottle is super cute.  I will most defenitely buy a different color for me.

The shade is beautifully pigmented, offering a rich and vibrant payoff However, the formula itself left me with mixed feelings. While it applies smoothly, I found it difficult to blend out, especially for more intricate looks. It doesn't layer well with other textures like glitter, powder eyeshadow, or cream products. This made it challenging to create a multidimensional effect or mix with other products for more complex looks. Additionally, the formula tended to set quickly, leaving little room for blending.  That said, it would work well for someone who prefers a more simple, one-and-done eyeshadow application. If you're going for a quick, bold wash of color, this could be a great option. Just don't expect it to be very versatile when it comes to layering or blending."

It is the perfect color for me, it doesnu2019t crease or crack, it doesnu2019t settle into my wrinkles on my lids, it wears all day, and it has the tiniest bit of glitter in it and the glitter stays put (it doesnu2019t end up all over my face like other shadows Iu2019ve tried). I gave it 4 stars because it canu2019t really be built up for more intensity without getting a little cakey and exaggerating the wrinkles on my lid (probably not a problem for someone with less lines on their lids) I wouldnu2019t normally wear it that way, I prefer a more u201cnaturalu201d youthful glow so itu2019s not a big deal for me. I also love that itu2019s so versatile. I can throw it on my lids in 30 seconds and just tap out the edges with my finger for a hint of color and glow for work or I can use it as the perfect finish to a smokey eye to add shine for a night out!"

Dior definitely has an optimally performing formula in their Eye Tints and the new Dior Eye Tint Shimmer Longwear Luminous Liquid Eyeshadow in 68S Tobacco is no exception! It applies with ease and looks just as stunning as their predecessors. I love how this liquid eyeshadow enhances the eyelid even if you have less than smooth texture on the lids thanks to the smoothing effect it lends after application. Although this formula is a best friend to mature skin, these eye tints look incredible on all ages & skin types! These liquid eyeshadows apply with ease and give you time to blend & perfect before dry down. They never get dry or flakey throughout the day and the wear time is exceptional! This new shade, Tobacco, is lovely while lending a shimmering effect in a neutral tone somewhere between a brown & bronze color scheme. It's unique in that I can't quite put my finger on the exact color, but I can attest to the gorgeous effect it provides. In my opinion, these are liquid eyeshadows at their best for quality & performance while elevating any eye look! I can't wait to get my hands on more of the new shades!  Please Note: I did receive this complimentary product in exchange for my review."

It has a sort of gel-like texture that feels nice on the eye and dries down  without feeling sticky.   I need to get more of these, because they make eye shadow so easy! I love that you can wear it alone for an easy daytime look or you can use it with other colors to get more dimensional/smokey looks for night time. Very happy I got this and want to try the viral black shade next!!"

The matte pink shade really doesn't blend as seamlessly as one would hope and it ends up looking a little patchy. I also think that the color itself is going to be a little hit or miss with people as it may look ashy on deeper skin tones. While I would recommend the eye tints in general, I wouldn't recommend this particular shade.  * I am a Sephora Community Ambassador and this is my honest review."

As I'm getting older, I've been gearing more towards neutral colors, with also having some flair to my style. I really love Georgio Armani's quality as a brand and especially love the long lasting nature of their foundation, so I was thrilled to try the eyeshadow. I've wore this shimmer recently for a full day wedding where the eyeshadow did not budge at all for the whole day! Best of all, the shadow was buildable, so I could do a smoky eye with it, or even wear it on its own. It has a very nice creamy consistency, which makes it easy to apply with the soft brush applicator included or with one of my other brushes. I'm excited to try other shades in the range and am really excited to add this to my collection. The best parts of the eyeshadow are longevity of the cream and the lovely hint of color. I've already told several of my friends about it and they've already rushed out to buy them and have raved about it too!"

This liquid eyeshadow provides a smooth, crease-free finish, and is perfect for a range of looksu2014from subtle daytime wear to dramatic evening glam.  Pros:   1. Blendable Formula: The liquid formula is easy to blend with either fingers or a brush, allowing for a smooth and even application. It can also be layered for more intensity without becoming cakey.  2. Pigmented Shades: The color payoff is impressive. A single swipe gives you a vibrant, bold shade, but itu2019s also easy to sheer out for a more natural look.  3. Long-Lasting: True to its name, this eyeshadow stays put for hours. Once it dries down, itu2019s smudge-proof, crease-proof, and resistant to fading, making it ideal for long days or special occasions.  4. Multi-functional: It can be used not only as eyeshadow but also as an eyeliner or even a base to build on powder shadows for more dimension.  5. Lightweight Feel: Despite the strong pigmentation, it feels light and comfortable on the eyelids, never heavy or sticky.  Cons:   1. Dry Time: You need to work quickly when blending, as it sets fast. If you donu2019t blend it out in time, it can be harder to soften edges.  2. Price Point: Like most high-end products, it comes with a luxury price tag. While the performance justifies the cost, it may be a splurge for some.  3. Limited Applicator Precision: The doe-foot applicator is great for sweeping across the lid, but for more detailed or precise work, youu2019ll need a separate brush.  Overall, the Armani Beauty Eye Tint is an outstanding liquid eyeshadow for those seeking long wear and high impact. Itu2019s perfect for creating everything from effortless, everyday looks to more artistic and bold eye designs. If youu2019re willing to invest in quality, this product delivers.  Feel free to let me know if youu2019d like any specific details or tweaks added!"

I've been wearing it to work, and it holds up all day without creasing until around 10-11 hours of wear. That's great wearability. I'd definitely recommend,  and I plan to buy additional shades because of how great this liquid shadow is.

Brilliant sheen when this eyeshadow catches the light glides on beautifully, and dries pretty quickly with no residue.

The formula is incredibly lightweight and glides on smoothly, providing an easy application that doesn't tug at the delicate skin around the eyes. One of the standout features is its pigmentation. A little goes a long way, and the colors are vibrant and true to what you see in the packaging. I was particularly impressed with how well it blends; it allows for seamless transitions between shades, making it perfect for both bold looks and subtle enhancements. The longevity is another huge plus. I've worn it for hours without any creasing or fading, which is a common issue with many tints. It holds up beautifully, even through a long day or night out, which is exactly what I look for in an eye product. As for the finish, it gives a lovely radiant look without being overly shimmery or glittery, striking the right balance for both daytime and evening wear. Overall, I highly recommend Giorgio Armani Eye Show Tint to anyone looking to elevate their eye makeup game. Whether you're a beginner or a pro, it offers versatility, quality, and that luxurious feel you'd expect from the brand."

The color is soft but noticeable, even with just one swipe. The shimmer is subtle and looks elegant, adding a touch of glamour to my look without being overly glittery like Tinkerbell.   What I love most about this eye tint is its long-lasting wear. It stays put all day without creasing or fading, even in hot and humid weather. The applicator is easy to use and allows for precise application.  If you're looking for a high-quality eyeshadow that looks great and lasts long, I  recommend Armani's Eye Tint in Shade 67. It's perfect for any makeup lover!"

Despite its high price point, this liquid eyeshadow offers a less-than-stellar experience.  One of the main drawbacks is its patchy application. Even with careful blending, the product tends to leave behind uneven patches of color. This can be particularly frustrating when trying to achieve a polished, professional look. Additionally, the color payoff is somewhat disappointing, especially considering the price. It requires multiple coats to achieve a noticeable intensity, which can be time-consuming and lead to a cakey appearance.  Furthermore, the longevity of the Eye Tint is questionable. While it claims to be long-wearing, it can crease and fade throughout the day, especially in warmer weather or with oily eyelids. This posed a major issue for me because I live in the desert, and I want my makeup to stay in place for extended periods."

The rate of fallout is the only reason I took away a star. Itu2019s full glitz and a whole bunch of fun!  I got this product free for my honest review."

This it the kind of thing you'd apply if you want to add some shine to the lid. Or, you could do what I did and wear it alone - the shine makes it so that the outer corners appear darker and the inner corners appear brighter simply because of how the light rays bounce off the shape of the eye. - Starts out sheer but is buildable. This is a good thing if you're using it to add some shine to your lid, as you'll still be able to see some of the baseline background color (if there is one). It blends quite sheer as well, but after a few strategically-placed coats, it should be pretty opaque. It's important to dab instead of swipe as much as you can. - The doe foot applicator with its fine tip really helps with precision - The sparkle/lustre is understated, classy, and elegant, making it a great product both for every day and a nice dinner out. If you want the bling bling this isn't the product for you. Note that it looks somewhat less sparkly after drying. - The formula contracts a little after it dries, leading to a tiny bit of wrinkling/bumping that is not super noticeable. However, given that the skin has lines and grooves and pores, this is par for the course with a lustrous, metallic finish. - This is a perfect option for my lazier days when I don't want to put on a ton of makeup but still want to look put together. Just swipe a bit of this on, maybe add a bit of mascara, and you have a really nice eye look. - Love the smooth, creamy texture that is not crumbly, clumpy, or sticky."

I also thought this color was going to be more wine-brown, which is great with my eyes, but it was more RUST, WHICH IS NOT."

It is quick to apply, blend out, and I am done.  simple. it is amazing because there is no fallout to exacerbate the wrinkles I do have under my eyes. what I have noticed is that people tend to think this is going to be a highly pigmented eyeshadow.  it is a tint.  as with any tint, there is going to be some sheerness to it. this tint is buildable. I am no makeup pro, but feathery light blending does the trick that and a little product goes a long way.  I bought 30m,22m, and 20m and find they are not patchy at all. as I stated in my headline, I am in love and will gladly spend the money on an eye tint that will last me a very long time."

I have ocular rosacea and oily-combo skin and havenu2019t had a problem. I also use the milk matte setting spray, which probably helps with the staying power.

The shade Senso doesnu2019t show up much in a sheer layer on my skin tone, so not being able to build this up kind of made this a pass in my book. As far as color, Senso looks like a slightly metallic taupe upon first glance. But I noticed that this shade can look differently depending on opacity and lighting, which makes it an unexpectedly dynamic shade. The subtle sheen that this shade gives is also honestly lovely. Overall, I feel that if I had a deeper shade that I could wear in thinner layers, I may have liked this a lot better."

The 56S color is basically like a shimmery plum color (very beautiful hue of purple. Because it is a liquid he shadow it can be easy to apply a little too much eye shadow on. What I did when applying this is to take the brush (which is a triangle shaped brush, thin and angled slightly slanted if you look at it from the side), I removed excess eye shadow from the brush by rubbing it on the outer part of the bottle before taking it out. Then I applied it on the bottom part of my eye lid (closest to the lashes). If you are going for your entire eye lid to be this color, I would apply it uniformly on the entire bottom lid and then take a brush to blend it out nicely (I added a base of a freakish color looking powder eye shadow to give it a base before applying). I also tried doing like a duo shade u2014 I applied a layer of a nude powder shadow first, then I applied a base layer on the lower part of my eye lid of a light shimmery lilac colored shadow. I blended out this shadow and then I applied the Giorgio Armani eye tint to the outer corner part of my eye lid in like a sideway triangle shape. I then took my brush and blended and it gave me a very nice effect. I would recommend this product as the product doesnu2019t come off even if you rub your eye. It is truly long lasting and leaves a nice shimmery look. I would say the this is a high end product more to the luxury side which is why it costs $36 for the 0.13 Fl Oz bottle. However, I will say that the price does match what it states about being long lasting. The packaging of the bottle is also nice and elegant, fitting of the brand."

I absolutely agree that it is longwear - it dries down really quickly and doesnu2019t seem to smear or smudge. I do kind of disagree with luminous as a descriptor, though. The liquid eyeshadow dries down to a matte finish, and then has some small sparkles throughout, when I think luminous it evokes a though of a dewy glow. That aside, the color is beautiful and the lasting wear is phenominal.  One small detail that I really love is the angle and shape of the applicator. The shape is perfect for easily applying to your eyelid, and itu2019s slightly angled to help with precision!  Once applied, itu2019s super light and feels velvety to the touch. It is not scented, which I love! Because of how long lasting it is, I would absolutely love to try some of the other colors. I think this nude color works great as a base to build off of as well."

Great for neutral and no makeup looks but I'll probabaly buy this in a brighter color for an easy one and done look.

This was my first time trying out an Armani eye tint and was so impressed with the quality and longevity of the product. Sunset is a gorgeous and unique pink-red color that can be easily shaded out or built up on the eye depending on how much color you are comfortable with. For me, I loved applying a small amount of the eye tint that was just enough to sheer out and compliment my green eyes in an easy, daytime look. The tint itself goes on so smoothly with no caking or creasing. What was extra fabulous is that the color lasted all day without the need to reapply. I seriously love this product and canu2019t wait to try other shades!"

I also like it because it is pigmented enough to be used in my brows or as a quick contour shade.   Packaging: The packaging is small enough to throw it in your bag and go. The applicator allows you to apply all over or in precise areas if you want to use it along the waterline or as a liner.  Overall, it's a good liquid shadow, but it's not anything new."

I absolutely love that I can do a neutral everyday look, a smokey eye or build up the pigment for a more glamorous look. The applicator makes it so easy to apply and the best part is I can use this anywhere without any brushes/tools.

Itu2019s simple at first glance but becomes more nuanced as you appreciate it, not unlike itu2019s namesake.  The eye tint is  a thin matte formula that doesnu2019t go patchy, nor does it cake on itself when layered. The applicator is the same hollow diamond doefoot as the Armani liquid lip colors.   Leather is definitely a capital L Look color, but, paired with a thin brush, itu2019s also the best eyeliner Iu2019ve ever used. Highly recommended for this alone."

It looks exactly the same as freshly applied at the end of the day. No creasing for flaking. Itu2019s perfect! You can build up the color for more intensity or sheer it out for a subtle shine. It even spreads nicely over powder shadow to use as a topper if you like. Itu2019s so versatile and easy to use. The shade I received 27 Sunset is a pretty pink/purple shimmer. Totally gorgeous!

You always wind up with way too much and are wasting product.   While I didnu2019t notice any creasing and it stayed all day, I hated the color so much I wish it hadnu2019t.

One thing I do want to mention about the formula is that it dries EXTREMELY quickly.  You need to work fast.  I found that using a blending brush spritzed with some setting spray moved the product around better than a dry brush.   The applicator has a unique shape, and blunt edges which makes it easy to create bold lines.  I imagine this would be very useful had I received a more bold color to test.

Unfortunately, even when using a shadow primer, I'm always left with fallout on my cheeks. At 41, this isn't a good look on me!   This is where my new Holy Grail Giorgio Armani Beauty Eye Tint in Rose Ashes came to the rescue! The packaging is so luxurious, and I love the applicator. The texture is so easy to blend on your eyelid that you don't even need to use a brush!   This shade absolutely topped off all neutrals and pinks for me.

This is a classic neutral taupe color, very thin formula, pigmented, rapidly drying but blendable with a finger or a stiffer brush for the first 8-10  seconds after application.  That means you need to do one eye at a time. Don't be tempted to apply bilaterally before blending. That will be a disaster. You need to apply on one eye and immediately blend the edges, then do the second eye. Once the eyeshadow is set it's not going to budge. On the swatches you can see the eyeshadow blended next to the full opacity swipe.  I own a few shades from the Armani line, but they're shimmery, which I love. I use them as bases for my eyeshadow looks and sometimes as one and done eyeshadows. This one would be great for a smokey eye, I just wish it had a little bit of shimmer or was more of a satin finish, that would be prettier than just a plain matte. I also noticed that it can settle into fine lines if not blended well, in fact, you can see that on my hand swatch. It might be because the finish is very matte. Hence the star off. The applicator is lovely, it gives you exactly the necessary amount of color on one swipe without leaving goopy droplets on the bottle's rim. Excellent packaging and esthetic of this product is a plus. Price is high for one eyeshadow though."

The formula is gloriousy shimmery without becoming a chunky glitter. This pairs so well with other cream products, but also works well with powder shadows too when I'm building out some dimension.

These do not have the opacity of a cream shadow, but the deeper shades seem to be more pigmented while the lighter shades are more translucent. I received the shade Gold Ashes, which is more of a champagne than a gold. A single coat yields a sheer wash of color and sparkle, but it is somewhat buildable if you let it dry fully between coats. Layering when wet just causes the product to lift and move around.  I prefer applying with a brush rather than the applicator. This keeps bacteria to a minimum, and makes blending easier than using fingers (though fingers are fine for a one and done application.) Work quickly, they set fast! On the bright side, this helps prevent transfer on hooded eyelids. Overall, I love the Eye Tint formula and the looks I can achieve using these products."

I have experience using liquid eyeshadows from various other brands, and the one thing that stands out about them is how shimmery they are. I was super excited for the Armani Beauty Eye Tint Liquid Eyeshadow because I expected a luxury makeup item to really deliver. I got the shade 12 - Gold Ashes because it is described as a beautiful gold/ champaign shade. When I first applied this, I noticed it was definitely a champaign shade and not really a gold shade, but thatu2019s really no problem because champaign is such a versatile shade that looks great on all skin tones. Next, when I started blending it out, I noticed the product moved around and I was unable to get the opaque finish I was expecting. I even let the layer dry down before reapplying, but the shadow kept moving around. For me, the finish is more on the sheer side, and the color payoff is not what I expected. As mentioned above, liquid eyeshadows are usually more pigmented and shimmery, and unfortunately I did not get that kind of look with this. For $30, I would expect this liquid eyeshadow to not only be buildable but also have a more intense shimmer payoff. Based on this experience, I would not purchase this in other shades."

Easily lay on a sheer wash of color or do multiple layers until it's opaque with zero caking and it lasts all day without creasing. I like to put on a the first layer, pat it out and gently smudge it with my fingertips or a large, dense shader eyeshadow brush then I either use that as a base for another product (other products powder or cream/liquid layer fantastically as if this were a primer) or paint on another, more precise layer to get that beautiful, opaque color and chrome finish."

Also one layer will give you a beautiful Sheen of color, which you can build up to be more intense if you like. Not much product is needed because of how pigmented it is. I used both my finger and the applicator to apply and both gave me beautiful results. I even found other uses for this liquid eyeshadow! I used it as a highlighter for my cheekbones and brow bone; I used it in my center pout after lipstick to give my lips a fuller appearance! I will definitely purchase this in some of the other colors! When I wore this out even just one layer , I received so many compliments from my friends AND strangers!

I thought it applied nicely if I used my finger to tap on a light layer and gently blended it. This gave me a more subtle look, perfect for a daily neutral makeup. The doe foot applicator was nice for applying more product for a fuller coverage, built up metallic sheen. I personally preferred my finger and/or a brush. It had decent wear time. I also liked it as a highlighter down the bridge of my nose and on my Cupidu2019s Bow. Iu2019d love to see this in an opalescent type shade, leaning towards blue and purple!

It's best for the one-and-done, all over the eyelid, natural glossy eye look. The teardrop shape applicator makes it easy to not only apply it to the eyelids but also the aegosal (aka under eyelids) and also the tear ducts for highlighting effect. The best part is that it doesn't crease and stay put through the day. I can definitely see myself buying more colors asap. I enjoyed trying out this eye tint and felt like it fits with the Armani beauty line."

I wear this all the time without primer and it lasts all day and I have no issues with creasing or wearing off throughout the day.

The product is marketed as being long-lasting, crease-proof, buildable, and lightweight, which I agree with; however, the particular shade I received for review was sheerer, so buildability was limited. As a topper shade, I think it works well. I didn't use any primer with it, and it stayed in place and lasted all day.  My fingers, the applicator, and a brush all worked well with this product, but you should probably use the applicator or brush if you want a uniform application. Additionally, I recommend waiting a few seconds before applying the product so that it dries down a bit, especially if you're using it as a topper shade.   Because of the time-consuming nature of using this product, I wouldn't repurchase it, but I think it's a decent product if you want to splurge and have a little extra time in the morning to use it. Even though you can use it as a one-swipe shadow, it is very glam."

Itu2019s a gentler metallic/chrome finish that is more mature than many Iu2019ve seen. There are very fine particles that cannot be felt on the skin, that give it a sexy shimmer without being too kiddish.   Longevity was good, I didnu2019t sweat or do anything strenuous to really test it, though.   Application was really smooth, I liked the size of the applicator.

The second way I wore it was using the applicator with multiple layers.  The buildable color is very easy, and it dries quickly, allowing the shadow to actually layer properly. The color itself is very shimmery/glittery, but there is no fallout.  The only con I found was when I touched my eyelid after applying the multiple layers, my fingers had a ton of glitter on them.

This it the kind of thing you'd apply if you want to add some shine to the lid. Or, you could do what I did and wear it alone - the shine makes it so that the outer corners appear darker and the inner corners appear brighter simply because of how the light rays bounce off the shape of the eye. - Starts out sheer but is buildable. This is a good thing if you're using it to add some shine to your lid, as you'll still be able to see some of the baseline background color (if there is one). It blends quite sheer as well, but after a few strategically-placed coats, it should be pretty opaque. It's important to dab instead of swipe as much as you can.  - The doe foot applicator with its fine tip really helps with precision - The sparkle/lustre is understated, classy, and elegant, making it a great product both for every day and a nice dinner out. If you want the bling bling this isn't the product for you. Note that it looks somewhat less sparkly after drying. - The formula contracts a little after it dries, leading to a tiny bit of wrinkling/bumping that is not super noticeable. However, given that the skin has lines and grooves and pores, this is par for the course with a lustrous, metallic finish.  - This is a perfect option for my lazier days when I don't want to put on a ton of makeup but still want to look put together. Just swipe a bit of this on, maybe add a bit of mascara, and you have a really nice eye look.  - Love the smooth, creamy texture that is not crumbly, clumpy, or sticky. -Compared with other liquid shadows, this is among my favorites for a chic, understated, one-and-done look."

This is a beautiful Metallic Rose gold eyeshadow, thin liquid formula with medium to full billable opacity. It dries down in 30 seconds, giving ample time for blending. An another layer can be added after drydown if needed. I used a matte mauve pink in the crease and this eyeshadow on the lid and it turned out beautiful. Unfortunately due to my eye anatomy I have severely hooded eyelids, therefore the eyeshadow creased on the portion of my eyelid that was touching. The part that wasn't touching stayed intact all day. If you don't have a droopy hooded eyelid then this eyeshadow is for you. Otherwise proceed with caution, it might crease on you."

I have used this on bare skin, with several different types of primers (more wet/emollient and drier formulas) and I find it works best on bare skin or drier primers.  When I swiped the Rose Gold eyeshadow on my eyes, it gave such a pretty wash of color and almost made my eyelids look a bit wet (which I love that kind of subtle color).  I did check to see if you can layer this and you definitely can if you let it dry down to almost dry, applying another layer on top does work and did not pill on me.  I also found it did not crease on me until about the 8 hour mark and that's also when the color started to fade a bit.  I was able to work quickly with it to blend with a darker powder outer lid shadow.    I have worn this consistently for about a week now and I really love how pretty and natural it looks, as well as how well it plays with my powder eyeshadows in my collection.  I plan to purchase a few other colors and finishes (this one is metallic).  I have recommended this already to several friends and will continue to do so.   The reason I took off one star are the claims that it is crease proof and lasts 16 hours.  It did crease on me after 8 hours and it lasted maybe 10 hours total.  Otherwise, it is a beautiful liquid eyeshadow."

When I tried to add another thin  layer, the existing product became patchy and dried out, doesnu2019t work with other shadows, almost no color payoff. I wanted something subtle, but this looks like a patcher patchy cream highlighter.  - Tips for use: Wotk quickly! Donu2019t prime lids with a sticky or waxy primer. If you want to use something, try spraying a setting spray onto a damp sponge and pressing onto the lid. Next, swipe a line of it into the back of hand, pick up with a dense eyeshadow brush and quickly tap it onto the lid. Donu2019t add other makeup other than a pencil liner and mascara It can create a quite subtle natural look this way."

The stiff waterproof sticks tug at my loose delicate skin now so can no longer wear them. The creamier ones crease.  So, despite the price, for me, these are really worth it. The colours are beautiful, don't fade, and I get a lot in a glass bottle. Plus they do layer incredibly well - I bought 4.  They dry *very* quickly if you want to blend so work fast.

It's a refined shimmer, not glittery, applies and blends out easily and can be sheered out or built up to look more foiled.  Once dried, it doesn't budge and I didn't have any fallout.  I do recommend applying it over a primer or glitter glue, especially those with hooded eyes, to avoid creasing if applying more than a slight wash of shimmer.  Although Magnetic is described as brown, it's actually more of a mid toned silvery taupe that easily pairs with many different looks.  I highly recommend these shadows and will definitely be picking up more colors."

I will say you do kind of really need to dig into the bottle to get product out, and still the bottle grabs at the applicator, like a mascara wand exiting the bottle, and pulls a lot of product off. The color Flannel is magnificent, perhaps the base is a nude pink but the iridescence (itu2019s probably really fine shimmer particles but itu2019s doesnu2019t look glittery at all) is pink, maybe-purple, it definitely has a cool-toned mauve look to it. I apply it over shadow or a primer right into the lid with the applicator and get good application all day, only some fading in the deepest part of my crease. This formula dries pretty quickly so you donu2019t have to worry about it creasing, like with a more creamy/ oily formula (Charlotte Tilbury creams). I will definitely purchase more"

There is plenty of time to apply and sheer out if desired and once they set they do not budge. Pretty incredible since removal is a snap. What makes them so perfect for older people is the fact that they do not crease... ever! They are pricey but it takes forever to finish a tube. Bonus... they double as totally unsmudgable eyeliners."

It still has about the same dimension on the lid. The product blends and sets beautifully. I did not experience any flaking or creasing throughout the day, and it played well with powder eyeshadows.   I gave it 4 stars because the wand is a little big for eyeshadow, and I know eventually it will dry out or it will become hard to use up all the product. With that, the full price - and even the sale price - is a little steep for what you get. But I am happy to have a distant cousin to my beloved Eyes to Kill shade."

The stinging stopped after a few minutes of wear...But all four times I tried this, my eyes watered for at least the first 30 minutes.  Personally, it's not worth it for me.  I don't understand why this product is raved about by bloggers.  This is a very sheer to light application.  You can't really build it up to opaque without it looking cakey.  It also creases after about 3-4 hours, even when I set it with powder or with an eyeshadow that usually does not crease.  If you need a sheer wash of eye color that only needs to last over dinner and you don't care if your eyes sting for a while, this will do.  I mean, it did look nice for the two minutes before my eyes started to water--I tapped it on my lid and into my crease and quickly blended the edges lightly with a synthetic brush.  It sets quickly.  But, again, hurting my eyes is not worth it so back it went.  On that note, I did discover that this is pretty waterproof against tears...so there's that."

They fade and end up stuck in my creases. This however, has been amazing.   It's long lasting without the smudge. Plus, its very easy to blend!  As far as color goes, I have a 2 mattes (taupe + nude smoke) & 1 shimmer finish (gold ashes). I absolutely LOVE to use the shimmer finish on the inside of my eyes & as a brow bone highlighter.   The matte colors I have are really great as a base or main eye makeup. Both are SUUUUUPER pigmented, which I really love because if a product is going to be crease resistant, it better stay on all day.

Flannel looks beautiful in the tube--I can only describe it as a gunmetal lavender with pink and gold shift. It is also beautiful when swatched on the hand. On the lids, though, it's a different story. It didn't show up at all on my light complexion. I tried adding more, but it still didn't show up, and it started to crease up.  I tested it in different lighting, and it unfortunately didn't work to my liking. I think someone who loves very subtle shimmers would be into this eye shadow color, but I can't justify paying $40 on such subtlety. And that is saying something considering that I love Korean style makeup. I'm sure there are other colors that are worth it, though. They do blend out beautifully and have the most complex color shift to them. Really pretty and expensive looking on the eye."

I didn't use too much to avoid it going all over the place since it was my first time trying this product. So, when I wanted to add more depth I just added a little more little by little to intensify my look. The product was very easy to blend and such a smooth, creamy texture. It doesn't crease up and it literally does dry like a normal eye shadow, which I think is pretty cool. Then to top the whole look off, I went in which the shade Gold Ashes which is the lightest shade from the trio I received for free from Influenster to review. I put this color on my lid and the color was very rich and still creamy like the other shades. Overall, this product is pretty unique because I never really thought of having a liquid eye shadow."

The wand is similar to a lip gloss applicator so itu2019s gently on your delicate eyelids. When you paint on your eyelids, you have to be sure to blend all the colors together to create the finished look. Then it will dry and feel like a powder matte eyeshadow. Smokey eye has never been easier and luxurious! BONUS: you can use the lighter shade as highlight as well!"

I was never a fan of cream shadows because they came in a pan and somehow ended up ruined really fast, also the colors offered weren't exactly very wearable.  This is a cool concept and Armani Beauty is executing it pretty well, I like the packaging because it is easy to work with the applicator, the shade range is very beautiful going from neutral everyday to glam shades, I can totally see me getting some more of these beauties.  Now to the shades I received.  Number 12 is very pretty, sparkly and beautiful, it can even be used as a highlighter.   Number 21 is hard to work with, I find it dries faster than the other two shades so you either blend fast or you end up with a mess. The shade is nice tho. Number 24 is beautiful and my favorite out of the three, you can even wear it on its own, add some liner and you're ready to go.  These last on a fairly good amount of time, they are easy to remove and not that hard to work with."

You have to make sure and apply just a small amount and blend appropriately.  That being said, the colors are fantastic, and I did not feel the stickiness that I get with other cream shadows.

I got compliments on it when I wore it alone. Nude smoke basically disappeared on my skin since it's the same as my skin tone, so it made for a wonderful base.

A little surprised that I like them, because there was a little bit of a learning curve in learning how to use them.  So the secret is to use a small brush (I like a stiff concealer brush) to blend it all in.  The colors blend beautifully and are surprisingly soft and natural looking.  To make the colors bolder and to add drama, simply layer the colors.  The more you layer, the more of a smoky eye you can create.  Once you get the hang of it, usually by the first application or two (thankfully it's a short learning curve) then you'll appreciate how moisturizing it makes your eyes feel  The colors are true (but softer than you'd think) and they last for quite sometime.  And they tend to stay put which is especially great if you have fine lines."

It's very shimmery which makes it so eye popping! The mattes are also amazing. They truly are matte and blend like a dream. I was afraid I might have trouble but they were pretty easy, the darker shades might require more care but they are able to be used with ease! You really only need to use a dab of product because of how pigmented these are. I have come to love the applicator since it allows you to add as much product as you need unlike squeeze tubes of similar brands. Definitely recommend!!

You have to blend within SECONDS of applying or else the product dries. So I had a pretty distinct line between the two colors I put on. Since that first experience, I stuck with the product and now know the best way to apply. Apply, blend, apply, blend, before it dries. The color is beautiful and seriously doesn't budge which is great for all day wear. The gold ashes color is my favorite for highlighting under the brow bone.

These are unlike any other cream eyeshadow that I've used because they're easy to blend out and apply, and they truly last all day. I was the most surprised with the way these go from cream and set to a powder formula. The formula allows the shades to blend in seamlessly onto one another and it allows the product to adhere so much better on the eyelids. You also get much more playtime to blend out the eyeshadows than with other cream eyeshadows, so you won't get any harsh lines. Plus if you end up getting a dark shade like 21, then you have a ridiculously simple smokey eye with absolutely no blending brushes needed."

I dabbed Fur Smoke onto the outer edges of my lids and the color blended really well into the Nude Smoke base. These two colors together are perfect for an everyday look. To glam up the eyes for evening, I used Gold Ashes in the inner corners and on the center of the lid for a pop of shimmer. The colors buildable and easy to layer. I love how low-maintenance and fast it is to use these Eye Tints!"

I used Fur Smoke in the outer third and as a liner - makes blue eyes intensely pop! They layer so well together and you can also layer powder formulas without any pilling.

I don't usually use liquid eyeshadow so I wasn't sure how I was gonna like them. After receiving gold ashes, nude smoke, and fur smoke, I am completely in love! They are a little on the pricier side but completely worth it in my opinion. They apply so easily the wand is super easy to use and I usually pat the lid color with my finger to blend it a little. For the crease color I usually use fur smoke and I just use the wand and then take a fluffy blending brush and blend it all out. These eye tints blend together seamlessly and dry completely matte without feeling heavy at all on the lids. Gold ashes is my new favorite product hands down. It has the most beautiful shimmer and glow to it. I've used it on my lid, as a tear duct highlight, on my brow bone, or as highlight on my Cupid's bow. It's AMAZING. overall, completely satisfied and will be purchasing more colors when I get the chance! 10/10. Thanks Armani and influenster!"

I use the lighter color up right under the brow, blend with my finger and the natural base all over the lid. I finish the look off with the ECCENTRICO mascara which makes my lashes look like they're HUGEEEEE! Looks like these are a little pricey but SOOOO WORTH IT if you want a beautiful eye look. I would definitely invest in a whole bunch more and get rid of the powder eye shadows. If you had to get just one, get NUDE SMOKE because its the PERFECT BASE to brighten your eye.

The only downside (which is why I gave four stars) is how fast it dries. It dries quickly so it is hard to blend more than one color and layer them without getting a little patchy. But it is completely doable and these things LAST all day and night so it is completely worth it.

It's great for your eye crease and brow bone! It's the perfect shimmer for Fall! I'd highly recommend blending with your finger or a really good eyeshadow brush as soon as you apply because they do dry up pretty quickly! The other two shades I received (fur smoke and nude smoke) have a matte finish rather than a shimmer finish. The nude smoke is great for a base eyeshadow and oh my gosh the fur smoke is just GORGE. You can create a natural look with these shades or a smokey eye! I love all 3!!"

It's not over the top at all, it's very tasteful, classy, and feminine. The formula is so nice, too, the liquid feels nice and soft going on the lids, the doe foot applicator makes getting it on mess-free a breeze. I recently received 3 more shades through influenster, and I couldn't be more thrilled. I received Nude Smoke, Fur Smoke & Gold Ashes. The formula of these is consistent with the first one I bought -AMAZING. Nude smoke is very light, and I feel would work well as an eyeshadow base/primer, but on its own gives a natural, bright look to the eyes and cancels out any veins. Fur Smoke is great to blend in the outer corners to add some depth on top of Nude Smoke. Gold Ashes adds a beautiful shimmer/glitter to the lid, but nothing over the top. I'm obsessed. That's all."

Once applied the product does not move or fade away. It doesn't feel sticky on the lids and last for a good amount of time.

I started out by patting it on with my finger but then used a brush to darken the crease AND wing it out and I had a complete look with one color! Once it's on it's on, I mean it basically waterproof. I didn't use a primer and it has yet to crease after 12 hours. Bonus: looks great smoked under your waterline! Another day I used this and then put a deep plum dry eye shadow over and it helped that stay in place. If you have the money to splurge I really think this is worth it. The packaging and quality is truly high end and durable and it will probably last at least an entire year. Also like I said I would try applying with a brush!"

This smokey color perfectly puts that shade back in, and it feels like permanent lipstick but for your eyes. The color 21 is an excellent compliment to use in the crease as a daytime smokey eye. The shimmery 12, makes a super pretty highlighter on the browbone and can even by blended down a bit to the outer eye/cheekbone. The formula dries to feel invisible, but the color stayed on all morning and afternoon. I added a little more smoke for a nighttime look, but didn't need any extra shade 12, as it stayed on brilliantly. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for an everyday quick makeup look."

With it being one of my first times working with this type of formula (creamy and a bit moussey) it took a while to figure out the methods that worked best for me.  I found that the shimmer and beige matte worked best applying with doe foot applicator then spreading with your finger.  The beige would not budge when trying to blend with a brush.  Once on, gave a very nice coverage and worked great as an all over shade.  The brown went on smoothly and blended effortlessly.  My favorite shade out of all three.   I'm glad I was able to try these out.  Don't see myself using the beige, but the shimmer I will continue to use as a shadow topper and the brown as an outer corner/crease color.

All it looks like is a pile of sparkles. Not good on my mature lids. Maybe the matte full size tubes are better. I may try one of the matte ones, if they too are pasty and dry, I will return. So far not looking promising. I am so surprised at Armani for the lack of quality."

I usually apply some to the back of my hand and then use a brush to apply.  You can also apply it under the bottom lash line and use a brush and smoke it out.  I have applied it to friends who in turn go out and buy their own. This will always be a part of my make up bag."

However, the eye tint + eyeshadow power comb is unbeatable in terms of blending and crease resistance. The eye tint does decently on its own for crease resistance but becomes a 16+ hour workhorse with the powder on top. (Neither the powder nor eye tint did as well solo and I have very crease-prone eyes when it comes to eye makeup.) I usually layer the light golden tint with the dark brown.

The only thing I don't like is that it is difficult to apply this precisely, I may use a fine brush the next time I apply it as I have been doting on the shadow with the brush it comes with and then spreading it out with my finger, also it does take about half a minute or almost a minute to really dry."

It comes off as more of a golden eyeshadow with a pretty pink duochrome shift. The effect is very subtle and absolutely gorgeous on the lids.  I see people complaining about the pigmentation on these eyeshadows, but I have no problems with it. The product advertises itself as an eye TINT, and it works exactly like that. They can be built up a little bit when you layer them, but are perfectly day/work appropriate with just one layer.  These eye tints are also quite cooling on the eye, which is nice for me in the mornings. The longevity of them on bare lids is better than most powder eyeshadows, but those with oily or hooded eyes would benefit from using a primer. They last longer with two layers than one, though be sure you are applying the layers thinly and letting them dry in between.  The price of them is definitely on the higher end, but I feel this would make for a great gift or as a treat to yourself if it's within your budget. Definitely check them out in stores if you can, though, swatches online do not even come close to how pretty they are in person :)"

At first glance and upon swatching all 12 shades, I picked up #8 Flannel and #11 Rose Ashes. After a few days of experimenting with them, I came to love the formula and colours. These were gorgeous yet subtle everyday shades Then I went back for some of the more colourful shades, in #4 Emeraude, #5 Onyx, and #7 Shadow. I intend to go back to get more of these lovely irresistible shades!  There is a lovely shimmer to these eye tints once applied, and the packaging makes them beyond easy to use. You can either apply straight from the tube/brush onto the eyelid and blend with your fingers or choose to blend out with a brush. You can even mix two different shades together to create a new shade.  The packaging also makes these very travel-friendly to toss into your bag on-the-go. Application only takes mere minutes to achieve a gorgeous eye look without having to choose from endless eyeshadow shades. The 12 shades of the Armani eye tints are all beautiful, and includes everything from natural and subtle (#9-12) to bold and colourful (#2-7). I definitely recommend checking these out in person to swatch and experience the highly pigmented formula. Absolutely my favourite new product of 2015!"

It goes on easily, it's pigmented, glittery without being too much, and it's easy to apply with the wand! I was able to use the wand to line the bottom lid. While my eyeliner started to fade as did the other shadow I used in the crease, this was still going strong 12 hours later! After about 13 hrs I noticed it start to fade (I do have oily eyelids - but I had applied UD primer as well). Even then there was no creasing at all. So maybe not 16 hours but still pretty impressive! After trying out this one I'll definitely purchase another - maybe one of the more vibrant colors. You should definitely give it a try - I'm really impressed and am curious to try other Armani products!"
